# Module-6-Challenge---Server-side-API-s---Weather-Dashboard

As someone who frequently travels, I want to be able to type in the name of any city into a weather forecasting application, so that I can easily view the upcoming 5-day weather forecast for that city as well as its current weather.

# Usage Instructions

Simply type the name of a city whose weather you want to search and view the results. Click on one of the previous cities searched displayed under the search form to view that city's weather again.
